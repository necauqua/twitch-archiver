## twitch-archiver

This is a simple Rust program that I wrote in a couple of afternoons that
connects to the Twitch chat IRC and archives all the messages forever.

The Nix flake also contains a simple NixOS module which defines a systemd
service that starts it and keeps it running.

### License
Like most of my work, this is licensed under MIT, meaning you can do basically
whatever you want with this code as long as you keep the original LICENSE file,
which has my name on top of it
